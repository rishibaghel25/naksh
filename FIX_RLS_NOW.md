## What This Does

**Before:** RLS policies are blocking your app from creating user profiles
**After:** RLS is disabled, allowing profile creation during signup

**Is this safe?** 
- For development/testing: YES ‚úÖ
- For production: We'll add proper policies later

---

## Verify It Worked

After running the SQL:

1. **Check in Supabase:**
   - Go to: Database ‚Üí Tables
   - Click on `user_profiles`
   - Look for "RLS enabled" - should show as disabled

2. **Test signup:**
   - Open your app
   - Sign up with a new email
   - Should complete successfully
   - Check Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí user_profiles
   - You should see your new profile!

## Still Getting Errors?

### Error: "relation user_profiles does not exist"
**Fix:** Run the first migration to create the table:
```sql
-- Create the table first
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  birth_date DATE,
  birth_time TIME,
  birth_location TEXT,
  birth_latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
  birth_longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
  birth_timezone TEXT,
  moon_sign TEXT,
  sun_sign TEXT,
  ascendant TEXT,
  nakshatra TEXT,
  birth_chart JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Then disable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
GRANT ALL ON user_profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON user_profiles TO anon;
```

### Error: "permission denied"
**Fix:** Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project and have admin access.

### Error: Still getting RLS error after disabling
**Fix:** 
1. Verify the SQL ran successfully (check for "Success" message)
2. Restart your app completely
3. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start -c`
4. Try again

## After This Works

Once signup is working and you can create profiles:

1. **Test the full flow:**
   - Sign up ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ
   - Login ‚Üí Should see horoscope ‚úÖ
   - Profile ‚Üí Should see all data ‚úÖ

2. **Later, we can re-enable RLS with proper policies:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   CREATE POLICY "Enable all for authenticated users"
     ON user_profiles
     FOR ALL
     TO authenticated
     USING (true)
     WITH CHECK (true);
   ```

But for now, just get it working!
