# No Testing Policy

## Rule
**NEVER create test files, test cases, or testing infrastructure for this project.**

## Specifics
- Do NOT create any files with `.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`, `.spec.ts`, or `.spec.tsx` extensions
- Do NOT create `__tests__` directories
- Do NOT create Jest, Vitest, or any other testing framework configurations
- Do NOT include testing steps in implementation tasks
- Do NOT write unit tests, integration tests, or any automated tests
- Do NOT create manual testing documentation or checklists

## Rationale
This project prioritizes rapid development and implementation. All validation is done through manual testing and real-world usage during development.

## What to Do Instead
- Focus on building functional, working code
- Implement proper error handling in the code itself
- Use TypeScript types for compile-time validation
- Test features manually as you build them
- Move quickly to the next feature
