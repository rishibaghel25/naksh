# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Table Missing Error
**Error:** `Could not find the table 'public.user_profiles' in the schema cache`

**Solution:** Created complete SQL setup instructions in `supabase/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**What to do:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the "All-in-One Command" from `supabase/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Run it
5. Done! Your database is set up.

### 2. Location Input - Map Selection
**Issue:** Users had to type their birth location manually

**Solution:** Created a map-based location picker with:
- Interactive map where users can tap to select location
- Search functionality to find cities/locations
- Automatic address lookup (reverse geocoding)
- Stores both address and coordinates (latitude/longitude)

**New Files Created:**
- `src/screens/auth/LocationPickerScreen.tsx` - The map picker screen
- Updated `src/screens/auth/SignupScreen.tsx` - Now opens map picker
- Updated `src/navigation/AuthStack.tsx` - Added LocationPicker route
- Updated `src/services/authService.ts` - Saves coordinates to database

### 3. InternalBytecode.js Error
**Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'InternalBytecode.js'`

**What it is:** This is a Metro bundler warning that appears when trying to symbolicate error stack traces. It doesn't affect functionality.

**Why it happens:** The app is trying to show detailed error information but can't find source maps.

**Impact:** None on functionality - your app works fine. It's just noise in the logs.

## Installation Required

You need to install `react-native-maps` for the location picker to work:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-maps
```

Then restart your dev server:
```bash
npx expo start -c
```

See `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## How the New Location Picker Works

### User Flow:
1. User fills out signup form
2. When they tap "Birth Location", they're taken to a map screen
3. They can either:
   - Search for a city/location in the search bar
   - Tap anywhere on the map to select a location
4. The selected location shows at the bottom with full address
5. User taps "Confirm Location" to return to signup
6. The location (with coordinates) is saved to their profile

### Technical Details:
- Uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API (free, no API key needed)
- Stores both human-readable address and precise coordinates
- Coordinates enable accurate astrological calculations
- Works on both iOS and Android

## Database Schema

The `user_profiles` table now properly stores:
- `birth_location` (TEXT) - Human-readable address
- `birth_latitude` (DECIMAL) - Precise latitude
- `birth_longitude` (DECIMAL) - Precise longitude
- Plus all other birth and astrological data

## Next Steps

1. **Install the map package:**
   ```bash
   npx expo install react-native-maps
   ```

2. **Set up your database:**
   - Follow instructions in `supabase/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Run the SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor

3. **Restart your app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

4. **Test the signup flow:**
   - Create a new account
   - Try the new map-based location picker
   - Verify the location is saved correctly

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/auth/SignupScreen.tsx` - Added map picker integration
- `src/navigation/AuthStack.tsx` - Added LocationPicker route
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Added coordinate handling

## Files Created

- `src/screens/auth/LocationPickerScreen.tsx` - Map picker screen
- `supabase/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Database setup guide
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Package installation guide
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Troubleshooting

### If the map doesn't show:
1. Make sure you installed `react-native-maps`
2. Restart the dev server with cache clear: `npx expo start -c`
3. Check your internet connection (needed for map tiles)

### If database errors persist:
1. Verify you ran the SQL commands in Supabase
2. Check the SQL Editor for any error messages
3. Make sure your Supabase project is active

### If location search doesn't work:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different search term (e.g., "New York" instead of "NYC")
3. The Nominatim API has rate limits - wait a few seconds between searches
